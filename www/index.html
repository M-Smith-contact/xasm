<h1>xasm.atari.org</h1>
<p><b>xasm</b> is a 6502 cross-assembler for DOS/Windows.
It is mainly targeted at Atari 8-bit computers,
but it can be also used for programming
Atari 2600/5200/Lynx, Commodore C64, Apple ][ and others.
<b>xasm</b> is freeware.</p>
<p><a href="xasm260.zip">Download version 2.6.0
(22 KB, includes full documentation)</a></p>
<p><b>xasm</b> no longer includes the tools X-BOOT, X-LOAD and X-HEAD.
If you really need them,
<a href="xasm252.zip">download version 2.5.2 (38 KB)</a>.</p>
<h3>Target audience</h3>
<p><b>xasm</b> is for people who are fluent in the 6502 assembly language.
There is no sample code for beginners, no easy-to-use libraries.
You are warned that programming 8-bit machines in the assembly language
is a tedious work.</p>
<p>There are several 6502 cross-assemblers to choose from and new ones
still appear. Just search the web. Make sure to not overlook
the <a href="http://www.cc65.org">cc65</a> compiler which includes
a cross-assembler, portable across many host and target platforms.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Although <b>xasm</b> does not support user-defined macros, it has a rich
set of built-in facilities.</p>
<p>Here is some typical 6502 code (also valid in <b>xasm</b>):</p>
<pre>
        lda #&lt;dest
        sta ptr
        lda #&gt;dest
        sta ptr+1
        ldx #192
do_line
        ldy #39
do_byte
        lda pattern,y
        sta (ptr),y
        dey
        bpl do_byte
        lda #40
        clc
        adc ptr
        sta ptr
        bcc skip
        inc ptr+1
skip
        dex
        bne do_line
</pre>
<p>And here is the same code rewritten in a xasm-specific way:</p>
<pre>
        mwa     #dest ptr
        ldx     #192
do_line
        ldy     #39
        mva:rpl pattern,y (ptr),y-
        lda #40
        add:sta ptr
        scc:inc ptr+1
        dex:bne do_line
</pre>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Although <b>xasm</b> comes with no editor, the documentation
describes integration (syntax highlighting and single-keystroke compilation)
with a few general-purpose text editors. Here is a screenshot
of the <a href="http://www.code-genie.com">Code-Genie</a> editor:</p>
