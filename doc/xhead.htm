<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
This tool prints headers of an Atari executable file.
It shows, into which memory areas the file loads,
and what are init and run addresses.<P>
<B>Important note:</B> X-HEAD is an extremely simple tool. Jindrich Kubec
wrote a tool with similar purpose, but much more features (disassembly
in different formats, including X-Assembler), called ChkExe.
You can find it on

X-HEAD will read the file and display its headers in following format:
<PRE> bbbb-eeee xxxx</PRE>
where <TT>bbbb</TT> is the begin, <TT>eeee</TT> - the end of the block,
and <TT>xxxx</TT> is the execution (init or run) address.<P>
The summary includes:<BR>
<TT>xxxx bytes</TT> - length of file, including headers<BR>
<TT>xxxx blocks</TT> - number of headers<BR>
<TT>xxxx inits</TT> - number of init blocks (<TT>02e2-02e3</TT>)<BR>
<TT>xxxx modules</TT> - number of <TT>FFFF</TT> headers (one at the beginning is required)<P>
All displayed numbers are hexadecimal, of course.
