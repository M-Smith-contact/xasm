<H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<B>What is xasm?</B><BR>
xasm is a set of a few tools for developing software for 8-bit Atari
computers using a PC computer. It is mainly for people who are familiar
with Quick Assembler, which runs directly on Atari.
<P><B>I want to run xasm on my Amiga / Atari ST / Mac / ...</B><BR>
Unfortunately xasm is written in x86 assembly language, so it is
not portable.
<P><B>Why xasm, not X-ASM as in previous versions?</B><BR>
It's easier to pronounce. ;-)
<P><B>Why final edition?</B><BR>
Because I don't plan adding any new features. xasm is already a very
sophisticated tool, much more powerful than Quick Assembler.
Of course, it does not mean there won't be any new releases.
Very likely there will be bug fixes.
<P><B>What about supporting other 6502-based machines, other processors (65816 etc.) ?</B><BR>
xasm is not a universal 6502 cross-assembler. If you need a portable
cross-assembler (and maybe even an excellent C compiler), then visit
