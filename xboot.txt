X-Boot 3.1 by Fox/Taquart
Some (un)important notes
-------------------------
This tool converts Atari executable (.COM) into Atari disk image (.ATR).
Produced ATR is single density and as short as possible. It has a loader
in one boot sector. You can choose one of two built-in loaders:
standard and professional. Professional loader allows you to load code/data
under ROM and disables ROM and interrupts while starting program.
Both loaders disable Atari Basic. For details, view sources of loaders.
X-Boot does not write your program in ATR as Atari file, you can only run it
by booting.
