X-Head 1.1 by Fox/Taquart
Some (un)important notes
=========================

The only change from version 1.0: Now .OBX is default extension.
---
This tool prints headers of Atari executable.
It also shows program init and run addresses.
Other things displayed:
xxx bytes - length of file, including headers
xxx blocks - number of headers
xxx inits - number of init blocks (02e2-02e3)
xxx modules - number of FFFF headers (one at the beginning is required)
You can redirect output to a file, for example:
XHEAD TEST.COM >TEST.HDR
